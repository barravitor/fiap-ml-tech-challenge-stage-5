## Introduction

This project was developed for the **FIAP Tech Challenge – Datathon**, where the main goal is to create a machine learning solution that evaluates the compatibility (**fit**) between a job opportunity and a candidate profile.

Our solution includes:
- A REST API built with FastAPI that receives job and user data and returns a binary prediction (fit or not fit), along with the confidence probability.
- A machine learning pipeline for training, validating, and managing models using **MLflow**.
- A modular architecture to allow scalability and integration with real-world HR platforms.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Machine learning model to predict candidate-job compatibility
- 🔌 RESTful API using FastAPI
- 📊 Model management and versioning with MLflow
- 🧪 Modular preprocessing and feature engineering
- 🔐 Token-based security layer (for future integration)
- 📝 Automatically generated API docs at `/docs`
- 🐍 Compatible with Python 3.10

- **🧪 RESTful API with FastAPI**  
  Interface for integration with external systems.

  **Available Endpoints:**
  - `POST /api/public/predict`: Sends input data and receives forecast output
  - `GET /`: Checks API health status

## Installation and run

Instructions on how to install and run the project locally.

---

### ✅ 1. Environment Setup
Create a .env file in the project root following the example in the .env-example file

Required python version: 3.10.12

```bash
python3.10 -m venv .venv      # Run to create the environment

# Activate the environment:
source .venv/bin/activate     # On Linux/macOS
venv\Scripts\activate.bat     # On Windows

# Set the PYTHONPATH:
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src  # On Linux/macOS
set PYTHONPATH=%cd%\\src      # On Windows (Command Prompt)
$env:PYTHONPATH="$PWD/src"    # On Windows (PowerShell)

# Install dependencies:
pip install --upgrade pip && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt # Run to install the necessary packages

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords'); nltk.download('punkt_tab')"
```

---

### 📊 2. MLflow
Run the mlflow
```bash
./start_mlflow.sh
```

Once executed, open your browser and access:

👉 http://localhost:5000

This will open the MLflow dashboard, where you can track experiments, models, and metrics.

---

### 🧠 3. Model Training

Before running the training pipeline, make sure to create a folder named `data` in the root of the project and place inside it the 3 JSON files provided by **Decision**.

**Expected folder structure:**

```
/data
 ├─ applicants.json
 ├─ prospects.json
 └─ vagas.json
```

To start the training process, run:

```bash
python ./src/training/pipeline/train_pipeline.py
```

This will execute the full training pipeline using the provided data.

---

### 🌐 4. API

Start the REST API with the following command:

```bash
./start_api.sh
```

Once running, the API will be available at:

👉 http://localhost:8000

You can now send requests to the API to interact with the trained model.
